# Data-Analysis
### Crude Birth Rate between 1960 and 2020
This Power BI visualization is based on the UN crude birth rate data sourced from [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CBRT.IN?most_recent_value_desc=true).
UN-crude-birth-rate-data.xls contains the main data used in the visualization whereas, Cleansed-crude-birth-rate.xlsx is the file after simple data cleansing was performed on the main data.
CBR.pbix is the visualization of the data after cleansing.

Microsoft Power BI would be needed to view the CBR.pbix file.
Thank you :-)
